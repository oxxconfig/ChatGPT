### About a large number of user network errors

### About still reporting mistakes

1. Reason: Reference [```About a large number of user network errors```](#About-a-large-number-of-user-network-errors). Solution: Replace the network.
2. Reason: Reference [```About Modify interval```](#About-Modify-interval). Solution: Adjust the interval of Keep moderately.

### About Other Errors

3. Reason: Cloudflare's bug. Solution: Privacy mode, clear cookies.

### About Cancel audit

1. OpenAI [audits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) all of a user's conversations, which [policy](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) can lead to account bans if the policy is frequently violated.
2. Ticked ```Cancel audit``` In the future, add your clever prompt words (must) to avoid banning to the greatest extent.

### About Modify interval

1. Refers to the time interval between staying online to OpenAI, in `seconds`.
2. The larger the time interval, the more relaxed the request and the more stable the account.
3. The smaller the time interval, the tighter the request and the fewer network errors.
4. Recommended intervals ```50``` More than a second.
5. The author usually sets it up ```900``` Second.

### About Conversation cloning

1. Quickly select, copy, paste, and edit with one click
2. Ticked ```Conversation cloning``` Later, you can click on the content of the conversation before ```Avatar``` for quick editing.
3. The comparison found that 5 redundant steps were omitted and the chat was smooth:

| Experimental environment | Uncheck Conversation cloning | Tick Conversation cloning |
| :------: | :--------------------: | :----------: |
| Step 1 | Command is issued | Command is issued |
| Step 2 | Get results | Get results |

2. Ticked ```Purified page``` In the future, the page will have a new look, enjoy the gold label, and enhance the sense of experience.

### About Wide display mode

1. Broaden your chatting horizons ```PRO```
2. Ticked ```Wide display mode``` In the future, mouse scrolling will be greatly reduced, and the dialogue will be clear at a glance, improving the sense of experience.

### About Complete response

1. Let ChatGPT express itself to its heart's content, without missing anything.
2. Ticked ```Complete response``` In the future, you can be unattended after asking a question and enjoy ChatGPT to express yourself to your heart's content until everything is replied.
3. After testing, this feature can make ChatGPT speak for up to 5 minutes and 30 seconds, greatly breaking the original 60-second limit.
4. The comparison found that 21 redundant steps were omitted and the chat was smooth:

| Experimental environment | Uncheck Complete response | Tick Complete response |
| :------: | :-----------------: | :------------: |
| Step 1 | Command is issued | Command is issued |
| Step 2 | Wait for the results | Wait for the results |
| Step 3 | Keep an eye on the results | Get full results |
| Step 4 | Incomplete results are obtained |  |

| Step 22 | Wait for the results |  |
| Step 23 | Keep an eye on the results |  |
| Step 24 | Get full results |  |

### About Intercept tracking

1. Capturing packets shows that the ChatGPT page uploads a lot of user environment information, performing extensive behavior analysis and user tracking.
2. Enabling ```Tracking Interception``` can block most tracking behaviors, protecting user information and improving page load speed.
3. Tests show that refreshing the ChatGPT page generates ```50~100``` network requests, with at least ```15~65``` requests tracking and analyzing users!
4. The author believes these requests are unnecessary! Hence, users concerned about privacy should enable this feature.

### About More chat info

1. Enhances the sidebar.
2. Enabling ```Constant Updates``` will display ```titles```, ```latest news```, ```dates```, ```days of the week```, ```conversation models```, etc., in the sidebar, helping users quickly locate high-quality historical chat items.

| LOGO | Conversation Model |
| --- | --- |
| Black Bubble | GPT3.5 Model |
| Purple Bubble | GPT4 Model |
| Purple Bubble + m | GPT4 Mobile Model |
| Purple Bubble + w | GPT4 Web Browsing Model |
| Purple Bubble + p | GPT4 Plugins Model |
| Purple Bubble + d | GPT4 Code Interpreter Model |

| Without Constant Updates | With Constant Updates |

### About Keen observation

1. Mimics chat software styles to enhance the distinction between user and robot chat bubbles.
2. Enabling ```Keen observation``` refreshes the chat page's appearance, improving the user experience.

### About Data security

1. Provides data security solutions, helping users intercept sensitive information to prevent data security issues.
2. Enabling ```Data security``` automatically cleans sensitive information (desensitizes) and provides risk warnings while users compose dialogues.
3. Please write data security rules according to regular expression syntax, with different rules separated by new lines.
4. The default data security rules are basic and need to be customized.
5. You can add your name, ID, computer username, company name, enterprise domain, etc., to the rules.

Here's a demonstration: If you type or paste this prompt into the chat box:
```
C:\Users\my-secret-username\Desktop> python login.py
  File "C:\Users\my-secret-username\Desktop\login.py", line 4
    if Mobile!"18888888888" and Email=="admin@163.com" : print("https://securiy-domain.com/login")
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

will be immediately corrected to:
```
C:\Users\\Desktop> python login.py
  File "C:\Users\\Desktop\login.py", line 4
    if Mobile!"" and Email=="" : print("/login")
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
